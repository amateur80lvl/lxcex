# LXCex

Lightweight privacy-focused desktop operating system based on Devuan and LXC.
A project for self-education, and yet another attempt to make an alternative
to [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/).
This is not a distro yet and probably never will.
This is a set of files and patches, a simple `makecex` script,
and an instruction Ã  la [LFS](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/).

Work in progress.


## Overview

* The base system (host system, or Dom0 in terms of Qubes) is running Sway.
* Networking container manages all physical devices, runs firewall and apt-cacher-ng.
* Virtual internal network provides truly static IP addresses to containers,
  making more or less complex routing robust when external IP address and/or devices change.
* Additional networking containers may run different VPNs for work, entertainment, banking, etc.
* User containers run Weston, Cage, Xwayland, etc. instances which get nested in Sway.

At the moment, this system reflects my experience and is full of personal preferences.
Some of them are quite baseless.
I swear I'll get rid of them as soon as the number of users go beyond 1.5.
But in general, the rationale is as follows:

## Rationale

* keep attack surface and fingerprinting surface as small as possible
* make [plausible deniability](https://github.com/amateur80lvl/pdt) easy

## Installation

### makecex

A bootable media with live system can be generated by this script.

Legacy boot mode for now.

The script contains parameters at the beginning, revise them carefully before running.


### by hands

* [Chapter 1. Installing the base system with debootstrap](https://github.com/amateur80lvl/lxcex/tree/main/book/ch1-installing-base-system.md)
* [Chapter 2. The basic networking](https://github.com/amateur80lvl/lxcex/tree/main/book/ch2-basic-networking.md)
* [Chapter 3. LXC and the base container](https://github.com/amateur80lvl/lxcex/tree/main/book/ch3-lxc-and-base-container.md)
* [Chapter 4. Networking](https://github.com/amateur80lvl/lxcex/tree/main/book/ch4-networking.md)
* [Chapter 5. Desktop Environment](https://github.com/amateur80lvl/lxcex/tree/main/book/ch5-desktop-environment.md)
* [Chapter 6. Pipewire](https://github.com/amateur80lvl/lxcex/tree/main/book/ch6-pipewire.md)


## Quirks

* Drop-down menus in Kate have significant offset to the right:
  * fixed after playing with systemsettings, need to reproduce
  * appear with a significant delay
    * sympthoms look like those described in merge request 1123
  * XFCE apps, e.g. Thunar, don't have such quirks. -- because of XWayland?
* Weston terminal does not honour user's shell from /etc/passwd and uses `sh`
  if Weston is started by runit, where parent shell is `sh`.
* When maximizing Chromium, top left position sometimes remains unchanged.
* Copy-pasting from Kate to Weston terminal drops newlines.

## TODO

* find the best way to create /run/user/<uid> in containers
* automatic move network adapters to container (udev rule?)
* wifi
* DHCP
* improve UX
* copy-paste across containers
* shared folders
* pipewire (video)
* composefs, when kernel 6.6 gets in stable release

## Wishes (TODO list?)

* A decent panel for Sway.
* Disable window decoration in Weston's wayland backend, not only in headless.
* A decent replacement for runit.
* Weston and wlroots-based compositors close session when connection to the socket
  is lost. Need re-connect feature.


## Changelog

### Jan 31, 2024

Yet another milestone: [makecex](https://github.com/amateur80lvl/lxcex/tree/main/makecex) is out!
This script generates bootable media.
Not excessively tested, it just works just for me.

### Jan 27, 2024

Packages repo is out. For now the only package there is uidmapshift.
Planning to add patched version of libpulse, thus getting rid of file permission fixer.

Although death from laugh is not my ultimate goal, I had to add signing key for me, anonymous.

Automation is on the way. Commenced after I managed to crash the system simply by remounting /var/lib/lxc with running containers.
Did not realize it's so dangerous.
This action destroyed all mounted partitions including backup USB stick which had nothing to do with that. Why???

### Jan 17, 2024

It plays music! Initial version of Chapter 6 is out, to be updated.

### Jan 16, 2024

XFCE desktop environment is working!

### Dec 30, 2023

Tag: 0.0.2
* Misc. tweaks.
* Made --no-install-recommends the default option, chapters 1-4 need testing.

### Dec 29, 2023

Initial commit and release.

### socket proxies

Discovered this article when wrote chapter 6:
https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/audio-via-pulseaudio-inside-container/8768
They use LXD and it's worth to take a look at the implementation od socket proxies.
Can we use them to retain container socket and reconnect to the host socket when
the base compositor gets restarted? Or when a container resumes from hibernation?

### mount namespaces and shared subtrees

* https://lwn.net/Articles/689856/
* https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt

Still don't get why I have to
```bash
mount --make-shared /run
```
i.e. `/run`, not `/run/user` if I `mount --rbind /run/user "${LXC_ROOTFS_MOUNT}/run/host/run/user"`
in containers and want all uid submounts to propagate.
